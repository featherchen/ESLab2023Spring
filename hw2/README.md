# HW2

## Mbed

The full package is uploaded. Modified files include main.cpp and mbed_app.json. Run visualize.py to setup the socket server and plot received data by matplotlib. main.cpp contains the code for reading sensor values. 

## CubeIDE

The full package is not uploaded because modified files are actually scattered all over the place. In CubeIDE, UI shows that main.c is placed under Application/User/, but this directory doesn't exist on my computer. That's why we only uploaded the modified files. File names are not changed, so after running .cproject, you can just replace our content into the files with the same name.

Configurations in .cproject, .project, stm32l4xx_hal_conf.h are modified. visualize.py is the same as Mbed's. 

Addtional header files are included in main.h. main.c contains the code for reading sensor values.
